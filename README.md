### an exciting new product brought to you by Team Resio

Database Setup - PostgreSQL
---------------------------
Ankio is built on a postgres database, which much be configured manually before you can start using the server. If you do not yet have postgres installed on a machine in your development environment, do that first. (The documentation already avaliable on that topic is superior to anything we could offer herein.)

Once you have Postgres installed, create a new database by typing `createdb` command in your terminal.
	
	`
	$ createdb ankio
	$ psql ankio

	ankio=#
	`
